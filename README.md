# Estimate real distance via least squares
This ROS2 package estimates the actual physical distance of an object from image-based depth predictions using a quadratic function fitted via the least-squares method. 

The estimated distance is then converted into a servo motor angle for real-world robotic applications such as object tracking or alignment.
